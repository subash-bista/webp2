                <p>The mail or post is a system for physically transporting postcards, letters, and parcels.[1] A postal
                    service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems.
                    Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as a government
                    monopoly, with a fee on the article prepaid. Proof of payment is usually in the form of an adhesive
                    postage stamp, but a postage meter is also used for bulk mailing.

                    Postal authorities often have functions aside from transporting letters. In some countries, a
                    postal, telegraph and telephone (PTT) service oversees the postal system, in addition to telephone
                    and telegraph systems. Some countries' postal systems allow for savings accounts and handle
                    applications for passports.

                    The Universal Postal Union (UPU), established in 1874, includes 192 member countries and sets the
                    rules for international mail exchanges.
                    Etymology

                    Mail envelope (back to back)
                    The word mail comes from the Medieval English word male, referring to a travelling bag or pack.[2]
                    It was spelled in that manner until the 17th century and is distinct from the word male. The French
                    have a similar word, malle, for a trunk or large box, and mála is the Irish term for a bag. In the
                    17th century, the word mail began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: "bag
                    full of letter" (1654). Over the next hundred years the word mail began to be applied strictly to
                    the letters themselves and the sack as the mailbag. In the 19th century, the British typically used
                    mail to refer to letters being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship) and post to refer to letters for
                    domestic delivery. The word Post is derived from Medieval French poste, which ultimately stems from
                    the past participle of the Latin verb ponere ("to lay down or place").[3] So in the U.K., the Royal
                    Mail delivers the post, whilst in North America both the U.S. Postal Service and Canada Post deliver
                    the mail.

                    The term email (short for "electronic mail") first appeared in the 1970s.[4][5] The term snail-mail
                    is a retronym to distinguish it from the quicker email. Various dates have been given for its first
                    use.[6][7][8]

                    History


                    Many early post systems consisted of fixed courier routes. Here, a post house on a postal route in
                    the 19th century Finland
                    The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or
                    place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. However, the
                    development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized
                    courier service for the dissemination of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers
                    for the dissemination of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BCE). The earliest
                    surviving piece of mail is also Egyptian, dating to 255 BCE.[9]

                    Persia (Iran)
                    Main articles: Royal Road, Chapar-Khaneh, and Angarium
                    The first credible claim for the development of a real postal system comes from Ancient Persia, but
                    the point of invention remains in question. The best-documented claim (Xenophon) attributes the
                    invention to the Persian King Cyrus the Great (550 BCE), who mandated that every province in his
                    kingdfrom accomplishing their appointed course with all speed".[10] The verse
                    prominently features on New York's James Farley Post Office, although it has been slightly rephrased
                    to Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion
                    of their appointed rounds.

                    rnization when the British Raj established its control over most of India.
                    The Post Office Act XVII of 1837 provided that the Governor-General of India in Council had the
                    exclusive right of conveying letters by post for hire within the territories of the East India
                    Company. The mails were available to certain officials without charge, which became a controversial
                    privilege as the years passed. On this basis the Indian Post Office was established on October 1,
                    1837.[16]

                    Rome
                    Main article: cursus publicus
                    The first well-documented postal service was that of Rome. Organized at the time of Augustus Caesar
                    (62 BCE – 14 CE), the service was called cursus publicus and was provided with light carriages
                    (rhedæ) pulled by fast horses. By the time of Diocletian, a parallel service was established with
                    two-wheeled carts (birotæ) pulled by oxen. This service was reserved for government correspondence.
                    Yet another service for citizens was later added.[citation needed][dubious – discuss]
